                                    <p>In the more than 40 years since <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/star-wars" target="_self"><em>Star Wars</em></a> first entered into the pop culture landscape, there have been a dozen feature films released (with plenty more on the way), plus dozens of television series, novelizations, comic books, trading cards, video games, and theme park attractions—not to mention hundreds of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/79395/10-star-wars-toys-you-might-own-are-now-worth-fortune">toys</a> and licensed merchandise sold (oh, the merchandise!) and one awesomely terrible <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72863/dark-side-oral-history-star-wars-holiday-special" target="_self">holiday special</a>. There have also been millions (if not billions) of words written about the films, from reviews to fan theories and beyond.</p>
    <p>In honor of Star Wars Day (May 4th), we’d like to add one more story into the mix. Here are some fascinating facts about the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, any one of which makes a perfect response the next time someone says “May the 4th be with you.”</p>
    <h2>1. The original <em>Star Wars</em> concept was inspired by Joseph Campbell.</h2>
    <p>Though equally inspired by fairy tales, westerns, and 1930s sci-fi serials, George Lucas based the framework of the story for the original <em>Star Wars</em> (1977) around the theories of Joseph Campbell’s book, <em>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</em>. The book tracked common mythological motifs and argued that myths from around the world that have been passed down through generations—like Beowulf or King Arthur—share a basic structure. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=I1uFuXlvFgMC&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;ots=oFel6vUGKm&amp;dq=A%20hero%20ventures%20forth%20from%20the%20world%20of%20common%20day%20into%20a%20region%20of%20supernatural%20wonder%3A%20fabulous%20forces%20are%20there%20encountered%20and%20a%20decisive%20victory%20is%20won%3A%20the%20hero%20comes%20back%20from%20this%20mysterious%20adventure%20with%20the%20power%20to%20bestow%20boons%20on%20his%20fellow%20man&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">According to Campbell</a>, “A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won; the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.” Lucas simply grafted these ideas onto his story, with Luke as the main hero.</p>
    <h2>2. Akira Kurosawa was another major influence on <em>Star Wars</em>.</h2>

    <p>Lucas struggled with just how to tell this massive sci-fi space opera on a personal and relatable scale, and he found the answer in director Akira Kurosawa’s 1958 film <em>The Hidden Fortress</em>. Telling the story of a roguish general protecting a beautiful princess from an evil clan behind enemy lines, “the one thing I was really intrigued by was the fact that the story was told from the two lowest characters,” <a href="http://www.starwars.com/news/the-cinema-behind-star-wars-the-hidden-fortress" target="_blank">Lucas explained</a> in an interview for The Criterion Collection’s release of the Kurosawa classic. “I decided that would be a nice way to tell the <em>Star Wars</em> story. Take the two lowliest characters, as Kurosawa did, and tell the story from their point of view. Which, in the <i>Star Wars</i> case is the two droids, and that was the strongest influence. The fact that there was a princess trying to get through enemy lines was more of a coincidence than anything else."</p>
    <p>Perhaps not coincidentally, the word <em>Jedi</em> is reported <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=93IHBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=jedi+jidaigeki&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f18Oete77d&amp;sig=ypRQFjwytr96LTOWBUGGYxEfTEU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6rk_Vcm4KojbsATCsoGYDQ&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=jedi%20jidaigeki&amp;f=false" target="_blank">derived</a> from the Japanese word <i>Jidaigeki</i> meaning “period dramas,” or the types of films Japanese directors like Kurosawa would typically make (the kind of movies that clearly influenced Lucas).</p>
    <h2>3. George Lucas’s first draft of the <i>A New Hope</i> was more than 200 pages long.</h2>
    <p>In 1973, Lucas submitted a 13-page treatment of his story, originally titled “The Star Wars,” to Universal Studios and United Artists following the success of his movie <em>American Graffiti</em> (which was nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture and a Best Director nod for Lucas) the same year. Both studios passed, saying the far-flung sci-fi extravaganza was too confusing.</p>
    <p>The treatment was eventually <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/judebrennan/2014/05/01/the-man-who-green-lit-star-wars-the-most-important-movie-mogul-youve-never-heard-of/" target="_blank">picked up</a> by 20th Century Fox head Alan Ladd Jr., who gave Lucas a preliminary deal in 1974 to eventually make the movie. But the “final” screenplay Lucas turned in was more than 200 pages long (the <a href="http://www.screenwriting.info/03.php" target="_blank">average</a> length of a screenplay is between 95 and 125 pages), so Lucas excised the final two acts and presented the first act of the screenplay as the finished story. The script was made into <em>Star Wars</em>, and the final two acts of the initial giant screenplay were eventually expanded and fleshed out into what would become <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> and <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.</p>
    <h2>4. Obi-Wan Kenobi was originally supposed to survive.</h2>

    <p>In 2016, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/56801/15-chewbacca-facts-honor-peter-mayhews-birthday" target="_self">Chewbacca</a> actor Peter Mayhew—who passed away on April 30, 2019—tweeted out some fascinating details about the <em>Star Wars</em> movies, including one shocking change: that in the original shooting script, Obi-Wan Kenobi actually survived his lightsaber battle with Darth Vader.</p>
    <h2>5. Visual aids helped to sell 20th Century Fox on <em>Star Wars</em>.</h2>
    <p>To get 20th Century Fox to approve the then-massive budget of almost $10 million (though the final budget eventually came in at around $11 million), Lucas pitched <em>Star Wars</em> with a series of 21 drawings he <a href="http://www.starwars.com/news/an-annotated-guide-to-the-star-wars-portfolio-by-ralph-mcquarrie" target="_blank">commissioned</a> from illustrator Ralph McQuarrie. These included scenes of C-3PO and R2-D2 crash-landing on Tatooine, Vader confronting Luke (then with the surname of “Starkiller”) with his lightsaber, the Mos Eisley cantina, The Millennium Falcon in Docking Bay 94, the attack on the Death Star trench, and a view of a floating city that would eventually become Bespin in <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>.</p>
    <h2>6. Harrison Ford’s casting as Han Solo was sort of accidental.</h2>

    <p>Lucas shared the seven-month-long casting sessions for <em>Star Wars</em> with his friend and fellow director Brian De Palma, who was casting for <em>Carrie</em> at the same time. Lucas was looking for unknown faces that he had never worked with before, and initially brought in Harrison Ford—who had appeared as the antagonist street racer Bob Falfa in Lucas’s <em>American Graffiti</em>—to feed lines to the auditioning actors.</p>
    <p>Lucas saw dozens of actors—including a young <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nix_PID3oiA" target="_blank">Kurt Russell</a>—for the part of Han, but liked Ford’s delivery feeding lines to the other actors so much that he caved and cast him in the part.</p>
    <h2>7. <em>Star Wars</em> Sound designer Ben Burtt had to get innovative.</h2>
    <p>Now-legendary sound designer <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0123785/" target="_blank">Ben Burtt</a> got his start on <em>Star Wars</em> fresh out of USC film school. He was tasked with coming up with a completely new and organic soundscape for the movie, which was at odds with the trend of creating intentionally electronic and “futuristic” sounds for sci-fi movies at the time.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/56801/15-chewbacca-facts-honor-peter-mayhews-birthday" target="_self">first sound effect</a> he created was Chewbacca’s voice, which is a blend of bear, lion, walrus, and badger vocalizations. R2-D2’s “voice” was made using loops on a synthesizer matched with beeps and boops modeled after baby coos performed by Burtt himself. Darth Vader’s infamous breathing was recorded by putting a microphone inside a regulator on a scuba tank. The Tusken Raider yowl is a mixture of mule sounds and people imitating mule sounds. The lightsaber whoosh was made by blending the hum of an idle 35mm film projector and passing a slightly broken microphone cable by the tubes of an old television set.</p>
    <h2>8. Orson Welles almost voiced Darth Vader.</h2>
    <p>George Lucas originally wanted Orson Welles as the voice of Darth Vader, but dropped the idea when he thought Welles’s famous baritone would be too recognizable.</p>
    <h2>9. The movie’s iconic opening crawl was created with practical effects.</h2>
    <p>The opening crawl for the original movie (which was <a href="https://youtu.be/qnOL8Fx3Tvc" target="_blank">cribbed</a> from the <em>Flash Gordon</em> serials that also inspired the film) was done practically, by carefully placing two-foot-wide die cut yellow letters over a six-foot-long black paper background with a camera making a slow pass over them to mimic the crawl. In total, it took three hours to shoot.</p>
    <h2>10. Robert Englund encouraged Mark Hamill to audition for <em>Star Wars</em>.</h2>
    <iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lSjP2GBTr9U" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><p class="canvas-text">According to Robert Englund, he <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/movies/why-mark-hamill-owes-his-star-wars-role-to-101847330777.html" target="_blank">auditioned</a> for the role of Han Solo but was told he was too young for the part (he would have been in his late 20s at the time). Which didn't stop him from suggesting his friend, Mark Hamill, audition for the film. “I said, ‘Hey, Lucas is doing this space movie. Maybe you’re right for it. The lead guy’s like a teenager,” the future Freddy Krueger <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yahoo.com/movies/why-mark-hamill-owes-his-star-wars-role-to-101847330777.html">recalled</a>. “So Mark got on the phone to his agent and I think he went up the next day. He nailed it, and the rest is history.”</p>
    <h2>11. Mark Hamill was paid $1000 per week to play Luke Skywalker.</h2>
    <p>Later on, he received a quarter of one percent of the film’s profits, so he didn’t make out too badly. <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> alone netted him <a target="_self" href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/69036/mark-hamills-original-star-wars-audition">$1 million</a>.</p>
    <h2>12. The original Millennium Falcon looked completely different.</h2>
    <p>The original <a href="http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110318004531/starwars/images/9/99/ManyMillenniumFalcons-TSWA.jpg" target="_blank">concept model</a> of the Millennium Falcon was long and cylindrical—very unlike the flat design we know now. The model makers complained the design was too similar to the <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a2/Eagle_under_attack.jpg" target="_blank">spacecraft</a> from the 1970s British TV series <em>Space: 1999</em>, so Lucas told them to create something completely different that looked like a flying hamburger and sailed like a sunfish.</p>
    <p>A variation of the Falcon prototype did, however, end up in the movie. It’s the <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Tantive_IV" target="_blank">Rebel Blockade Runner</a> seen fleeing the Imperial Star Destroyer in the opening scene.</p>
    <h2>13. George Lucas used real-life war footage for <em>Star WArs</em>'s space battles.</h2>
    <p>Industrial Light and Magic is now one of the preeminent special effects companies in the world, but back in the late 1970s it was just a group of artists in an empty warehouse in Van Nuys, California. The company, which invented technology like special computer-controlled camera rigs in order to create the special effects for <em>Star Wars</em>, was tasked with completing a year’s worth of work in just six months.</p>
    <p>To give them ideas for the type of high-intensity and cutting-edge sequences he wanted, Lucas used old newsreels to cut together footage of World War II dogfights. ILM eventually matched many of the sequences frame by frame—including the space battle in the Millennium Falcon between Han, Luke, and the TIE fighters—directly to the footage Lucas provided.</p>
